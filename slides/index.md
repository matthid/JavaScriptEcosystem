' Kontroverses Thema

### Open Source Definition

Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software with its source code made available with a license 
in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

---

### Knackpunkte

- ~1980 Free Software Movement
- 1997 The Cathedral and the Bazaar
- 1998 "Open Source Initiative"
- 2001 "open source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business."

' "Free" Software -> Incompatible with business
' Microsoft
' Eric S. Raymond
' Cathedral: Centralized and under control
' Bazaar: De-centralized and shared

---

### Bazaar?

- Users should be treated as co-developers
- Early releases
- Frequent integration
- Several versions
- High modularization
- Dynamic decision making structure

' "Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow." -> Nutzer haben oft selbst hohe Fähigkeiten
' The first version of the software should be released as early as possible so as to increase one's chances of finding co-developers early.
' Code changes should be integrated (merged into a shared code base) as often as possible so as to avoid the overhead of fixing a large number of bugs at the end of the project life cycle. Some open source projects have nightly builds where integration is done automatically on a daily basis.
' There should be at least two versions of the software. There should be a buggier version with more features and a more stable version with fewer features. The buggy version (also called the development version) is for users who want the immediate use of the latest features, and are willing to accept the risk of using code that is not yet thoroughly tested. The users can then act as co-developers, reporting bugs and providing bug fixes.
' The general structure of the software should be modular allowing for parallel development on independent components.
' There is a need for a decision making structure, whether formal or informal, that makes strategic decisions depending on changing user requirements and other factors.

### "I'm not a lawer"

' Can only give some general ideas

---

### The four philosophies

<img src="images/oss-licenses.png" style="background: white;" width=700 />

' Open -> MIT/Apache 2.0
' LGPL -> Änderungen müssen zurückwandern, einbindung in kommerziellen Code möglich
' GPL -> Einbindung in kommerziellen Code nicht möglich
' AGPL -> Cloud!

### What the GPL?

### Microsoft

"We use open source - along a lot of other reasons - to improve our internal work flow and cross project contributions"

### Standards

"Open source software is usually easier to obtain than proprietary software, often resulting in increased use. Additionally, the availability of an open source implementation of a standard can increase adoption of that standard"

> http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/

' Standards schaffen
' Standards verdrengen

---

### Quality

"The OSS development approach has helped produce reliable, high quality software quickly and inexpensively."

> http://www.jmir.org/2011/1/e24/

---

### Innovation

"It is flexible because modular systems allow programmers to build custom interfaces, or add new abilities to it and it is innovative since open source programs are the product of collaboration among a large number of different programmers. The mix of divergent perspectives, corporate objectives, and personal goals speeds up innovation"

> Plotkin, Hal (December 1998)

---

### Security

"Moreover, free software can be developed in accord with purely technical requirements. It does not require thinking about commercial pressure that often degrades the quality of the software. Commercial pressures make traditional software developers pay more attention to customers' requirements than to security requirements, since such features are somewhat invisible to the customer."

> https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2575.2002.00118.x

' custom needs -> custom audit

---

### Sustainability

"Open source is not dependent on the company or author that originally created it. Even if the company fails, the code continues to exist and be developed by its users. Also, it uses open standards accessible to everyone; thus, it does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software. "

### Bazaar?

<img src="images/nope.jpg" style="background: white;" width=700 />

---

# 3%

of projects use the bazaar model. There is always someone in charge.

---

# 93%

of NPM packages with just one maintainer.

---

> I guess we all just need to hope that maintainers of those projects will never quit, get bored or decide that they have better things to do in their spare time…

---

## 1/2 of contributors only contribute once

They account for < 2% of commits.

---

<img src="images/contributions_omnisharp.png" style="background: white;" width=700 />

---

### Risk?

- Using OSS powered by businesses
- Fixing bugs for free (compare with running license costs!)
  -> Hard to make transparent
- Buying SLAs from external consultings?
- Evaluation is hard
- "left-pad"?

---

### Vorteil proprietärer Software

- Direkter Ansprech- und Vertragsparter
- Alles aus einer Hand
- "Günstiger" als Beratung

---

"Businesses have a process for buying things they need."

"They don't have one for giving away things for free."

### Business-Secrets?

' 80% digital infrastructure -> "no brainer"
' 20% business critical -> individuell

---

### Future

- recognize the importance of our "digital infrastructure"
- open market closed by new business ideas
- financial maintainer support or own developers
- working on open-source will be "the norm"
- businesses will learn to deal with it

' controlling the direction
' building own features
